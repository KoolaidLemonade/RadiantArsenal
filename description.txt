Radiant Arsenal is a mod that plans to add new and unique subclasses along with a new resource that they share: radiance, to perform special attacks with those weapons. With this resource, it also adds new functions to some vanilla weapons that seemed forgotten and unused

This mod is currently under development. Expect to see more content in the future
